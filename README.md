# Generative-Pattern
This project creates customizable textile patterns for saris and other fabrics, focusing on three main designs: triangles, symmetrical squares, and asymmetrical squares. Users can modify these patterns through an intuitive draggable UI, allowing them to design shapes by adjusting coordinate points for unique and personalized textile art.
